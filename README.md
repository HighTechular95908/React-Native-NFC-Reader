# React-Native-NFC-passport-Reader
# This is the report about our working so far.

>**NOTE:** So many deprecated, no longer supported node modules and native modules, we've struggled into our work hardly.

# Comprehensive
# 1.Get started React Native TypeScript!

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

**This may seem like a silly story, but it's an important one.**

## ✔️Using template

```bash
npx react-native init NFC --template react-native-template-typescript[@6.12.*]
```

> Best matches with react-native-nfc-passport-reader module follow the below:

| React-native | template |
| ------------ | -------- |
| 0.70         | 6.12.\*  |
| 0.69         | 6.11.\*  |
| 0.68         | 6.10.\*  |
| 0.67         | 6.9.\*   |
| 0.66         | 6.8.\*   |
> **NOTE:** We 'll intend to install a template comes with Gradle7.0~7.2.
Because NFC modules typically have compitability with Gradle7.0~7.2.
To build or release your App, this is very important step.

> **NOTE:** After install a template, to avoide some errors, remove the "node_modules" directory.
> And then, at first, install @best-network/react-native-nfc-passport-reader before another modules (react, react-native etc.)

## ✔️Running your first App

> **Note**:Make sure that you have installed the Android Studio (or only Emulator) and followed [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Once you installed your first template, you can execute your first App by the following commands:

```bash
#using npm
npm run start

#in another terminal
npm run android
```

(in the case of me, Android 2022, JDK 17)
